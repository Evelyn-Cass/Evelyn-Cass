##
<br> I'm Evelyn Cassinotte, and I'm studying Software Development at FATEC - JAHU College.<br> I'm currently in the third semester of a six-semester program.<br> <br> I would like to explain a little about what I learned in each semester:<br>

First Semester:<br>

- Database Modeling: I learned the theoretical aspects of relational databases and how to use DDL and DML commands.
- Web Development I: I was introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Algorithms and Programming Logic: I learned how to think logically and create algorithms using VisualG.

Second Semester:<br>

- Relational Database: I was taught about procedures, aggregate functions, views, subqueries, and triggers.
- Data Structure: Using JavaScript, we explored data types and data structures.
- Programming Techniques I: Using PHP and MySQL, I learned Object-Oriented Programming.

Third Semester:<br>

- C# with ASP.NET MVC: I learned to build web applications using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, focusing on clean design and scalability.
- Non-Relational Databases: I worked with MongoDB and learned how to integrate it with C# back-end applications.
- Software Engineering Practices: I was introduced to version control, architectural design, and development best practices to improve teamwork and maintainability.

<br> In each semester, I needed to develop an Interdisciplinary Project to put my skills to the test. To fulfill this, I joined a team of women, and together we created [Localize Jahu](https://github.com/Localize-Jahu/Localize-Jahu.github.io), a platform to find events in Jaú City. In the first semester, we developed the frontend, and in the second, we applied Object-Oriented Programming using PHP and MySQL.

In the third semester, I decided to challenge myself and take full responsibility for the project. I developed, on my own, a document management platform for [CIPA (Internal Commission for Accident Prevention) at FATEC Jahu,](https://github.com/Evelyn-Cass/fatec-jahu-cipa) using C# with ASP.NET MVC and MongoDB. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also tested my ability to manage an entire project independently — from planning and database design to front-end and back-end development.
