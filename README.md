## Hello there!<br>
I'm Evelyn Cassinotte, and I'm studying Software Development at FATEC - JAHU College.<br>
I'm currently in the third semester of a six-semester program.<br>
<br>
I would like to explain a little about what I learned in each semester:<br>

**First Semester:**<br>
- **Database Modeling**: I learned the theoretical aspects of relational databases and how to use DDL and DML commands.
- **Web Development I**: I was introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Algorithms and Programming Logic**: I learned how to think logically and create algorithms using VisualG.

**Second Semester:**<br>
- **Relational Database**: I was taught about procedures, aggregate functions, views, subqueries, and triggers.
- **Data Structure**: Using JavaScript, we explored data types and data structures.
- **Programming Techniques I**: Using PHP and MySQL, I learned Object-Oriented Programming.
<br>
In each semester, I needed to develop an Interdisciplinary Project to put my skills to the test. To fulfill this, I joined a team of women, and together we created
Localize Jahu(https://github.com/Localize-Jahu/Localize-Jahu.github.io)
, a platform to find events in Ja√∫ City. In the first semester, we developed the frontend, and in the second, we applied Object-Oriented Programming using PHP and MySQL.
